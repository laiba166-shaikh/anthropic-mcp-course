# Working with Resources

Resources in MCP servers allow you to expose data to clients, similar to GET request handlers in a typical HTTP server. They're perfect for scenarios where you need to fetch information rather than perform actions.

### 🏗️ MCP Resources vs. What You Know

| **If you're familiar with...** | **MCP Resources are like...** | **Key advantage** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **File Systems** | Files the AI can browse and read | Discoverable and structured for AI |
| **REST API GET endpoints** | Read-only API endpoints | Built-in metadata and categorization |
| **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** | Knowledge base for AI context | Standardized across all AI platforms |
| **Documentation Sites** | Docs the AI can navigate | Self-describing with rich metadata |
| **Database Views** | Queryable data collections | AI-friendly formatting and discovery |

## Key Characteristics of Resources

- **Read-only**: Resources provide data, not actions
- **URI-based**: Accessed through specific URIs with optional parameters
- **MIME-typed**: Support various content types (JSON, text, images, etc.)
- **App-controlled**: The application decides when to expose resources
- **Static or templated**: Can be direct resources or parameterized

Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.
​
### Resource URIs

Resources are identified using URIs that follow this format:

[protocol]://[host]/[path]

For example: 
- file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf
- postgres://database/customers/schema
- screen://localhost/display1

The protocol and path structure is defined by the MCP server implementation. Servers can define their own custom URI schemes.

### Resources can contain two types of content:
​
1. Text resources contain UTF-8 encoded text data. These are suitable for Source code, Configuration file, JSON/XML data eyc.
​
2. Binary resources contain raw binary data encoded in base64. These are suitable for Images, PDFs, Audio files Video files and Other non-text formats

## How Resources Work?

Resources follow a request-response pattern. When your client needs data, it sends a ReadResourceRequest with a URI to identify which resource it wants. The MCP server processes this request and returns the data in a ReadResourceResult.

Resources can return any type of data - strings, JSON, binary data, etc. Use the mime_type parameter to give clients a hint about what kind of data you're returning:

"application/json" for structured data
"text/plain" for plain text
"application/pdf" for binary files
The MCP Python SDK automatically serializes your return values. You don't need to manually convert objects to JSON strings - just return the data structure and let the SDK handle serialization.

## Types of Resources

There are two types of resources:

### 1. Direct Resources
Direct resources have static URIs that never change. They're perfect for operations that don't need parameters.

### 2. Templated Resources
Templated resources include parameters in their URIs. The Python SDK automatically parses these parameters and passes them as keyword arguments to your function.

## Protocol Messages Structure
​
### 1. Listing Resouces

To discover available resources, clients send a resources/list request. This operation supports pagination.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "resources/list",
  "params": {
    "cursor": "optional-cursor-value"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "resources": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs",
        "name": "main.rs",
        "title": "Rust Software Application Main File",
        "description": "Primary application entry point",
        "mimeType": "text/x-rust"
      }
    ],
    "nextCursor": "next-page-cursor"
  }
}
```
### 2. Reading Resources:

To retrieve resource contents, clients send a resources/read request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "contents": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs",
        "name": "main.rs",
        "title": "Rust Software Application Main File",
        "mimeType": "text/x-rust",
        "text": "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello world!\");\n}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### List Resource Templates

Resource templates allow servers to expose parameterized resources using URI templates. Arguments may be auto-completed through the completion API.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "resources/templates/list"
}​
```
